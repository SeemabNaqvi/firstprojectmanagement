Plan for Usage:

Issues will move from To Do to In Progress once work starts. Upon completion, they will transition to Done. Regular updates will ensure that the board reflects the real-time status of the project, promoting transparency.

Linked Issues with Milestones:
"Login Functionality Fails Under High Load" → Resolving this ensures the application is scalable and meets the release standard.
"Write Unit Tests for Payment Module" → Testing is critical for ensuring that the module performs reliably in production.

Reflection on Project Management Tools
GitHub's project management features, such as milestones, issues, and project boards, streamline collaboration and ensure efficient project tracking. Milestones help teams align their work with specific objectives, fostering a sense of purpose and clarity. Issues enable detailed task descriptions, bug tracking, and feature requests, ensuring that every aspect of the project is addressed systematically. Project boards provide a visual representation of the project's status, helping team members prioritize tasks and maintain accountability.

Despite these benefits, challenges like ensuring consistent updates, managing overlapping tasks, and balancing workloads among team members may arise. However, with regular communication and disciplined use of these tools, these challenges can be mitigated, leading to an organized and productive workflow.
