Plan for Usage:

Issues will move from To Do to In Progress once work starts. Upon completion, they will transition to Done. Regular updates will ensure that the board reflects the real-time status of the project, promoting transparency.

Linked Issues with Milestones:
"Login Functionality Fails Under High Load" → Resolving this ensures the application is scalable and meets the release standard.
"Write Unit Tests for Payment Module" → Testing is critical for ensuring that the module performs reliably in production.
